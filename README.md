## About This Fork

This is a **fork** of the original [File-Sharing-Bot](https://github.com/CodeXBotz/File-Sharing-Bot) project by [CodeXBotz](https://github.com/CodeXBotz). The primary focus of this fork is to make the bot **run on Termux** without requiring a **MongoDB URI**. Instead, this version uses **SQLite** as the local database.

### Key Differences:
- **SQLite Database**: The database code has been rewritten to use SQLite, making it easier to run locally without needing a cloud-based MongoDB setup.
- **Termux Compatibility**: This fork is optimized for running on Termux (Android) or other local environments.
- **No Cloud Deployment**: Due to the use of SQLite, this fork is **not suitable for cloud deployment** (e.g., Heroku, Railway, etc.). If you need cloud deployment, please use the [original project](https://github.com/CodeXBotz/File-Sharing-Bot).
